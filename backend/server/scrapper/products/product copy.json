Painted in a clean beige hue which most peoples colour palette would acknowledge as being more yellowish than anything. Across the Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Linen's iconic upper, a mesh stripe shoots across the lateral side panels. A now traditional motif signature on all the more recent additions to the Yeezy 350 portfolio. Accompanying this again, a brand standard set of fit laces offer the only purely functional feature on the design. Contrasting the subtle beige/yellow hue that imprints the Yeezy Linen's upper and midsole, in injections of baby blue that are presented on the sockliner and aforementioned mesh stripe. While further complement is paid to the design via a rose pink outsole that lines the bottom of the patented Adidas Boost unit. This pastel imaginary is perfect for Spring and Summer, hopefully capturing imaginations, improving outfits everywhere.",

The Semi Frozen Yellows bright neon colourway is sure to cause a splash in the last few months of 2017 heading into 2018, arguably the most controversial ‘SPLY-V2' yet and said to be the most limited. Whether you are a fan or a critique Kanye very much takes the stance that all publicity is good publicity, and you can't argue everyone is taking notice.

This slick shoe's stylings which we have all come to expect from Kanye West's designs has refreshingly been given a unique new detailing for the last month of 2018, going into the New Year. The Yeezy 350 Static is unlike any previous release we have seen, and it is becoming more and more evident that although existing in direct competition with one another, both Kanye West's Yeezy and Virgil Abloh's Off-White ranges, might quite possibly be cross-pollinating.

The Yeezy Slide is known for its unbeatable comfort and minimalist aesthetics, thanks to the single piece of EVA Foam the silhouette is crafted from. You can find Adidas branding on the footbed of the slide, and that is all with minimalism key for the design of the slides. If you need a versatile piece of footwear, the Yeezy Slide is the perfect option.",

      "description": "This week we were treated with the re-release of the Yeezy Slide Bone colourway, as well as two new colourways in Core and Soot. Although coming under some scrutiny when first released, the slide has since made a massive impact on the sneaker industry once people found out just how comfortable they were. The idea behind the silhouette was for wearing around the house or wherever you want to be cosy. This Yeezy slide is perfect for that. The light bone colourway is instantly recognisable as a Kanye creation as natural hues have become a mainstay for Yeezy releases. The futuristic look is down to the entire silhouette being crafted from once piece of rubber. The deep ridged sole is fitting when you look at the armoured style soles we are used to with Yeezy sneakers. Branding is minimalistic and can only be found on the insole. With everybody working from home during lockdown, the Yeezy Slide is essential to be able to keep flexing whilst not leaving the house.",

As Lebron James looks set to add another title to the trophy cabinet, you should most definitely be looking to add the Yeezy QNTM to your sneaker cabinet. The QNTM shoe was elevated to grail status when we saw Ye passing the sneaker out to passer's by at NBA all-star weekend in Chicago, back in February. The sneaker later saw a wider release and was an instant sell-out. This upcoming release is the second time we have seen an additional colourway of the highly sought-after basketball sneaker, following the release of the Barium earlier this year. The sneaker features a high-top design for additional ankle support, which has long been the norm for basketball silhouettes. A primeknit upper of course features, which we know offers comfort like no other. The uppers feature the classic neutral colour hues that Kanye loves to use, but with the addition of teal blue cross-stitched throughout to make the sneaker pop. Down below, a translucent midsole runs up the sides of each sneaker to give the shoe an incredibly futuristic yet sleek look. With the QNTM being one of Kanye West's more exclusive releases, we can guarantee the teal blue will be an instant classic. Be sure to add to your rotation today.",

The t-shirt for your feet mantra that has been instilled through Kanye West's collaboration with Adidas is on display for all to see in this creation, and in many ways started the trend; soft Primeknit is utilised on the upper which showcases a gradient effect of black and off-white. A set of integrated rope laces are included, and a spiralled tubular sole sits underfoot. To complete the design, a subtle touch of red is stamped to the heel pull. This shoe is a piece of history, a trendsetter, a trailblazer, and everything that came after the Turtle Dove has it to thank for being the Yeezy equivalent of the first man on the moon.",

Marking some newfound trends within the silhouette’s lexicon with soles marked with a middle stripe down its entire construction, breaking up the surrounding gum with a white accenting piece. Side stripes along the upper detail exist in the same fashion, even forgoing the patterns typically found on almost every prior release. The sunflower shade I previously referred to actually comes out as more of a dark mustard on the shoes interior and liner. One thing is for certain, although the Yeezy 350 is dropping colourways a lot more sparingly in 2020, the quality is still there with ever model.",

Coming complete with an almost identical midsole unit. The differing elements present on the Magnet colourway arrive above and beyond this. With an upper engineered from a combination of neoprene, suede and leather which arrives in a palette of grey gradients. While the outsole switches to a gum varient and exudes throwback appeal. Reflective accents remain at the heel for visual interest in low light, something that has become an almost ever-present of all-new Yeezy models.",

The iconic Boost technology put both Adidas and Yeezy on the map when it comes to sneaker comfort and durability. The Boost comes housed within a dusky brown armoured outsole.

So naturally, by the time the Yeezy Boost 750 Black was finally unveiled in December 2015 anticipation was close to boiling point and Kanye West didn't disappoint. The second colourway of the now iconic Yeezy Boost 750 line, the ‘Black’ trainer features a full suede upper, perforated vamp, and ankle zipper, and if you are lucky enough to get your hands on a pair of these very exclusive kicks, they are definitely a status symbol and a collector item.",

The distinctive colourway is inspired by Kim Kardashian’s Armenian heritage and named after Mount Ararat, a volcanic mountain found in the Armenian Highlands that is believed to be the home of Noah’s Ark. At first glance, you might question how the shoe relates to the mountain, but the white aesthetic is inspired by the snow-caps of Ararat. The execution is just as interesting as the slip-on’s history, as it is created from a unique foam compound that combines harvested algae with a lightweight EVA. As a result, the Yeezy Foam runners will feel comfortable and lightweight each time you slide them onto your feet. The monochromatic colourway and sculpted lines create a futuristic aesthetic while complementing many everyday looks. The oval cut-outs across the upper boost airflow, making the slip-ons ideal for the beach or street.",

These sneakers feature an off-white buttery leather that enhances the sneakers vintage vibe and takes us to a much more reminiscent and less groundbreaking place, and after all, there has never been anything wrong with tribute acts. This kick is for someone who wants to be in the Yeezy conversation but is rooted in more traditional trainer cliches, a homage to a simpler time, one just as stylish as the here and now.",

This project indicates the first time Wotherspoon has worked with Adidas, but if his previous collabs are anything to go by, these are going to be an instant classic. The sneaker Wotherspoon has added his touch of magic to is none other than the cult classic Superstar. A shoe made famous by Run DMC many years ago is now celebrating its 50 anniversary, so it made perfect sense for Sean to add the Round Two vibe to this silhouette. The theme behind the sneaker is sustainability, which makes perfect sense with Wotherspoon being a proud vegan. The shoe will be made with vegan-friendly products and constructed of upcycled fabrics. The shoe features multi-coloured flowers stitched across each side. This vibrant colour scheme is something that we now expect with the designer's work. A slightly stranger aspect of the shoe is the paper laces included. The iconic shell-toe of course features, whilst the sole remains white rubber to ensure the sneaker still looks and feels like a superstar. A cork insole, composite padding and a sock liner crafted from waste rubber rounds of this sustainable take on a classic. If you want to want to stand out from the crowd, then look no further than Wotherspoon's latest masterpiece.",

Taking inspiration from the hiking culture of Los Angeles and more rural California, and channelling retro outdoorsmen vibes, the Sun Glow delivers unparalleled comfort, something which has become a cornerstone of the collaborator's partnership. What sets this colourway apart is its teal coloured Primeknit that is utilised across the upper with contrasting hits of white used for the iconic HU wording. On this pair, the word ‘CLOUDS' makes an appearance. The design and colour palette is quite evidently a nod to the blue skies and white clouds of the Los Angeles skyline, and what better way to celebrate that, then a new pair of kicks.",

Stamping his individuality on everything from the Stan Smith to clothing and sportswear, this legendary producer has made an impact on current footwear. Now turning his attention to the hugely popular NMD, we have this stylish iteration to the range. Featuring equipment yellow Primeknit uppers with black embroidery reading ‘HUMAN' on the right foot and ‘RACE' on the left, the design also includes a black foot cage, white Boost midsoles, black bumpers, and a white outsole. This reimagining of the classic silhouette is apparently set to be another win for Pharrell Williams and another excellent entry into his ever-growing portfolio of trendsetting work.",

That makes this a sneaker perfect for summer and hotter days, as well as a stylish winter option. The crafted upper is made from glossy deep brown leather on the mid and includes brown laces on top. This then switches to a bright red mesh fabric on the toe box, mid sides, and collar, also for extra ventilation. The upper also includes glossy red leather around the toe and towards the heel.

Combining a grey uncaged Primeknit upper as the name suggests with suede accents and a crimson Continental rubber outsole this shoe echoes the homeland of the designer and its simple aesthetic is no less striking. Expected levels of comfort and breathability are of course achieved through the Ultra Boost technology deployed; this shoe is well executed and definitely one to be considered.",

The uppers are moulded to feel like you are putting on a sock, which is fantastic for breathability and comfort. Meanwhile, the BOOST technology integrated into the shoe's sole is intended to significantly reduce shocks created by hard impacts and make the NMD R1 more durable in a wide range of conditions. The subtle black with white lettering on the side of the sole reflects the performance ethos behind the shoe, with only the Japanese lettering cleverly translating as The Brand with the Three Stripes to give the game away.",

      "description": "Sneakers don’t get more fun than the Kerwin Frost x adidas Forum Hi Humanchives sneaker. The iconic silhouette has allowed people to express themselves via the footwear since 1984, and this 2021 sneaker is the perfect way to showcase your style and personality. The distinctive design was born from a collaboration with Kerwin Frost, a Harlem-born entertainer and comedian, who has, without question, put his stamp on the iconic silhouette. At first glance, the sneaker might appear like a blue and white iteration, but you’ll quickly notice the eyestay eyes, nose on the white laces, and lips and teeth that wrap at the toe. Of course, the head-turning sneaker includes iconic adidas Forum details, such as a leather upper, lace closure, a hook and loop ankle strap, a perforated toe box, and Three Stripes on the medial and lateral quarters.",

Presented in a red and offwhite colourway complete with distressed marks that punctuate the upper, a nod to Kevin’s mishaps while defending his home from thieves Harry and Marv. Furthering the celebration of the family classic, the Home Alone x adidas Forum Low White Red also comes with detachable foot insoles printed with iconic scenes from the movie, pins of objects in the house that Kevin used for self-defence and a branded tag. This shoe is perhaps more a collector's item than it is a fashion statement but the conversation it will insight between avid fans and curious friends is part of the kick's more general appeal.",

Building on from Pharrell Williams' previous collections that have celebrated diversity and goodwill, it's hardly surprising that this pack opts for such an inspirational theme. This particular iteration boasts a more understated theme compared with others in the Hu Holi Pack. But subtle detailing still manages to set this apart as an exclusive. This model features a Core Black upper accented by Deepest Purple laces, TPU lacing cage and EVA midsole inserts. The word 'EQUALITY' is embroidered in white on the upper left shoe, with matching Devanagari text on the right one. A white Boost midsole and Core Black serrated outsole finish off the design. This shoe is an interesting take on a classic NMD, and definitely adds an exciting blend of Asian spices to this wonderfully celebrated silhouette.",

      "description": "This week we see the highly anticipated return of the Prada x Adidas Superstar. The collaboration sees luxury fashion royalty Prada take over one of sportswear's most recognisable silhouettes, the Adidas Superstar. Prada brings its expertise to turn the shoe into a luxurious version of itself. This white and black version is the closest match to the classic colourway we all fell in love with fifty years ago. Still a relatively minimalist vibe, these are put together from the highest level of premium leather. You cannot have a Superstar without the iconic three stripes taking the spotlight, dressed in black to compliment the white upper. The timeless looking sneaker is topped off with the Prada logo embossed on the heel. A dual-branded tab features on the tongue but is one of the only places you will find this. A luxury sneaker like this does not need branding all over, minimalist heaven. The chunky midsole houses Adidas cushioning across the entire length of the shoe. If you're looking for luxury meets comfort, this Superstar is what you need.",

      "description": "Few fans of The Simpsons will forget the episode when Homer accidentally invents a cocktail that's stolen by his friend and local bartender, Moe, which he coins The Flaming Moe. If you remember it well, you might be thrilled to learn adidas has honoured the classic episode in a recent collaboration with the much-loved cartoon series. The Simpsons x adidas ZX1000 Flaming Moe's sneakers are guaranteed to stand out on your feet. The vibrant purple colourway is constructed from premium, suede, mesh, and nylon that exude comfort and luxury. The cartoon-style The Simpsons x adidas ZX1000 Flaming Moe's design is created with clever use of bold black lines to separate the vivid colours from each other. It differentiates the red Three Stripes from the fire motif on the sidewall, a reference to the Flaming Moe cocktail. A vibrant red Flaming Moe's logo pops on the tongue tab, ensuring everyone understands the inspiration behind the cool shoes.",

It features a sock-like silhouette due to the flexible and soft Primeknit upper, contouring to the shape of each foot for a breathable, adaptable fit. The champagne colourway allows the black synthetic Three Stripes to pop on the lateral sidewall. Also, splashes of red on the outsole, heel pull, and tongue pull add energy to the retro yet contemporary design.

The unique design puts a romantic spin on the innovative sneaker, featuring various brown accents that subtly pair with a strawberry jewel. For instance, the chocolatey hue appears in various shades and materials on the quarter’s Three Stripes, the heel mudguard, and the elongated heel counter. If you look closer, you’ll find a soft beige suede mudguard at the toe and pale pink on the sock lining, tongue trim, ankle strap, and underfoot. Various logos give the sneakers the brand’s seal of approval, as it features the famous Trefoil logo near the collar and on the midsole.",

This pack follows on from the clean and refined ‘Blank Canvas' Collection. Unlike that release, this Pharrell HU NMD sports an eye-popping upper. Just like the explosions of colour seen across the Indian subcontinent during the Holi festival, this pair features a tie-dye printed Primeknit. This colourway is a fusion of oranges, greens and purples which feature in an acid-wash effect. It's totally unique and makes this silhouette especially appealing for the summer months. All the conventional Hu details are present from the integrated laces to the synthetic sidewall caging. This shoe is definitely a unique piece and not one for the fans of the understated, it is genuinely channelling the paint parties of the Indian Festival, and so when you wear it you feel like you are wearing something more than just a shoe.",

The Air Jordan 1 Retro High x Off-White purposely looks half-finished in some of its detailing, visible blue stitching, \"Air\" text printed on the midsole and an Off-White Zip tie all culminate to let everyone know this is an Off-White collaboration. The modern twist on an already established heavyweight is the primary draw for this product and the many other remixed silhouettes in the Nike x Off-White range. Taking a product as overwhelmingly popular as the Air Jordan 1, and breathing new life into it in a way only Virgil could is what makes this trainer a must have. If you love high tops and you like Off-White, well this is a match made in heaven for you, I can promise you, you aren't going to find a better high top around right now.",

The upcoming Mid reflects the banned AJ1 perfectly and will be a must-cop for fans of the silhouette. Premium leather uppers feature across the Air Jordan 1 Mid Banned's panelling, with the heel and the toe box featuring the Chicago Bulls red just like its OG counterpart. The legendary swoosh features down the lateral and medial sides of the sneaker, also in that same striking red. Perfectly contrasting underlays of black make this sneaker pop, with the wings logo on the ankle finishing off the almost identical look of the shoe. Underfoot, a white midsole features with a red outsole to complement the sneakers 'Bred' colourway. Nike Air technology features to guarantee comfort whether you are looking to hit the court or the streets in them. The Air Jordan 1 Banned is the closest release we have seen to the original colourway in quite some time. Be sure to add these to your winter rotation as they will most definitely sell out.",

The phrases include ‘No Photos' embroidered across the heel of the left and right shoe, ‘Wear Me' across the tongues and ‘Please Crease' stamped on each toe box, as well as ‘Not For Resale' printed across the side of the white heel.

With this newly released Top 3 colourway, the pair in question takes a new lease on life by way of the past’s “Fire Red,” “Metallic,” and “Grape” notables. With vibrant hits of purple and aqua blue adding a pop of colour along the tongue and its embedded Jumpman insignia, to a mostly black dominated composition. All of which is topped by the midsole molds and “23” lettering of the “Fire Red,” to add a final stamp to this fresh design.",

      "description": "The collaboration between the Jordan Brand and DJ Khaled was a dream come true for the American DJ, as he once stated he was a \"sneakerhead from birth\" and owns a sneaker collection worth a reported $8 million. The music mogul's passion for sneakers is clear in this latest Sail-coloured interpretation of the Air Jordan 5 Retro, which is a part of his \"We The Best\" collection with the sneaker giant. The sail colourway is likely the most suitable sneaker for everyday wear from the collection. The muted upper balances the hits of colour across the design, such as a bubble gum purple midsole, gold-speckled blue spikes, a black mudguard at the heel, and a translucent outsole with a hint of orange at the forefoot. You can't help but notice the silver padded tongue with the signature black Jumpman, which serves as a symbol of quality.",

Unique yet understated, this shoe features a familiar yet different aesthetic compared to other Jordan 4 silhouettes, and it takes some of Jordan Brand's classic features and combines them with a clean and modern design. Even though the Houston Oilers relocated, I can assure you that the ‘Cactus Jack' is here to stay. Go cop a pair.",

The bold University Gold upper, ankle flap, heel counter, and medial and lateral Nike Swooshes harmonise with mustard yellow overlays on the eyestays, toe cap, mudguard, and collar. The black quarter, tongue, and wings motif on the ankle flap pull back the vibrancy, and the white midsole balances the mix of colours, creating a versatile design that will work with many looks you own. Designed for on and off the court, the premium leather construction ensures the sneakers are comfortable, durable, and supportive. The Air-Sole unit at the heel provides more flexibility, spring, and cushioning for a comfy, lightweight, and protective feel. The gold rubber outsole will improve your traction when walking across various surfaces.",

Little did any of us know that MJ and the Jordan Brand would become some of the biggest names in their respective industries. The Tinker Hatfield creation recently celebrated its 30th Birthday, indicating the perfect time to retro a classic. The Jordan 4 Fire Red comes crafted from only the best leathers, with a clean, white colourway dominating the colour palette. Black and red accents that feature throughout contrast the crisp upper perfectly. The branding used mirrors the OG exactly, with a Jumpman logo on the tongue and Nike Air on the heel. Sneakerheads love it when the Nike Air branding replaces the Jumpman on the heel, giving the Jordan 4 Retro Fire Red an even more retro feel. Down below, a red, white and black sole houses Nike Air technology to ensure these stand the test of time. A visible air unit also features, leaving no doubt this is a retro of the '89 original.

The smooth leather, all-black construction features its signature flat laces, black branding, and nylon tongue. Also, the solid sole units remain the same. The only difference you might notice is the Jumpman logo on the tongue tab is now black to maximise the stealthy aesthetic.",

Contrary to what people first thought when images began to surface, you can have the tongue at full length as you would generally see on Jordan 4 models. Union founder Chris Gibbs has also added his usual personal touch with the addition of the Union LA yellow tab featured on the side panelling of each Jordan 4 Retro Union Off Noir shoe.

The two powerhouses saw great success with their Jordan 1 design back in 2014, so seeing the partnership return is no surprise. The sneaker was initially teased back in April 2019 by Fragment Founder, Hiroshi Fujiwara. We are glad to see an official release some 18 months later finally. For this collaboration, the pair have decided to take over Tinker Hatfield creation, the Air Jordan 3. The shoe comes dressed in an 'Orca' colourway. The upper and midsole come in a crisp white colour scheme. Black panelling features in the middle of the silhouette to contrast the white perfectly. The use of tumbled leather throughout the entire sneaker gives it that luxurious feel as soon as you pick up a pair. Branding is kept to an absolute minimum with the Fragment logo only featuring on the heel of each shoe behind a transparent Jumpman logo. This sneaker is most definitely going to have sneakerheads going wild, a must-cop for anybody wanting to upgrade their collection with an incredibly sought-after collab.",

Unfortunately, the Mid never quite hit the dizzying heights of the High. However, with colourways like the upcoming Sesame, that will all change. Premium, white panelling and a white swoosh is contrasted perfectly by beige underlays. Additionally, you can find pops of red on the ankle collar of the sneaker, whilst the wings logo also features in red. Finally, a pastel blue hue is used for the sock liner and features on the sole unit bringing the whole design together.

      "description": "This pair of Air Jordan 5 Blue Bird Womens combines a favourite silhouette with soft pastel shades of blue. An even softer look is accomplished by using brushed suede panels to build the majority of the upper, while this is contrasted with a perforated fabric side panelling. Larger eyelet pieces create a more interesting look with extra lacing holes complemented by the touch of blue on the laces. The sole of the Womens Air Jordan 5 Blue Bird is given a curved look in keeping with the soft and smooth design, with a jagged-cut white suede panel atop a deep blue midsole, finished with the baby blue back on the outer sole. The suede is broken up by a shiny silver tongue adorned with the Jumpman logo. Altogether, the colour scheme and jagged lightning-like stripes on the sole give a must-have retro vibe.",

The left comes in a palette of greens and blues, whilst the right is composed of reds and oranges mostly. We see watch faces feature across the shoe's laces whilst graffiti working features around the outsole of each shoe.

      "description": "The Raging Bull Air Jordan 5 was initially released way back in 2009 and is one of the silhouette's legendary colourways. This release is the first time this AJ5 has dropped in Grade School sizing. The uppers are crafted from buttery suede throughout, with a Raging Bull red hue used for the sneaker's colourway. Black accents compliment the legendary design, with the Jumpman logo on the heel contrasting the shoe's upper. MJ's jersey number, 23, features on the sneaker's heels finishing the upper's design. Underfoot, a black sole unit houses Nike Air technology which guarantees comfort wear after wear. The shark tooth design across the midsole features a partly translucent outsole showing off another Jumpman logo.",

Firstly, at the \"Figures of Speech\" exhibit, Chicago, then again in Off-White's Paris FW20 show. We are glad to finally see a release date set with the 25th of July. The sneaker was also placed on eBay recently by Abloh to raise money for various Black Lives Matter organisations. Fetching a final sale price of around $186,859.49 you know the hype for Off-White collaborations shows no signs of slowing down. This Jordan 4 comes dressed in an extremely minimalist colourway, featuring Sail, Cream and White accents throughout. The classic Jordan hangtag also in cream, staying consistent with the rest of the shoe. How do we know this is another Virgil Abloh collaboration? You have the ever-present Off-White zip-tie for instant recognition, as well as the notable \"AIR\" branding on the heel.

The uppers are, once again, covered in a synthetic material with transparent holes on the sides of each shoe. Yellow plastics feature on the shoe eye stays to give the silhouette a truly vintage feel. We also see pops of red throughout the sneaker to contrast the shoe's minimalist design. The iconic Jumpman logo and MJ's jersey number both feature dressed in the colour. From a technical standpoint, Nike Air technology runs along the sole for optimum comfort. The visible air bubble lets you see this legendary invention. If the Off-White x Air Jordan 5 in Black was anything to go by, this the Sail Cream colourway is going to be an instant classic.",

The cool kicks retain the original shape and construction from the 1990s and include the popular GEL-Lyte 3 split tongue design. The sleek sneakers feature an ivory and grey mesh and suede upper, contrasting with jet-black laces and splashes of mint green. The quarter and heel webbing provides an extra layer of texture and contrast with the black leather ASICS branding in black. All-day comfort is expected due to the popular GEL cushioning technology unit inside the white midsole.",

The contrasting white stitching breaks up the black upper while showcasing the quality of its construction. Yet, it’s the large white star on the heel that will draw the eye as you walk down the street.

Working in harmony with the distinctive snakeskin are the rubber toe box and translucent rubber midsole. You’ll need to look closely to find the hidden branding on the basketball kicks.

      "description": "Converse is rivalling the biggest sneaker brands for creative collaborations, as partnerships don't get much cooler than its pairing with A-COLD-WALL, a London-based luxury streetwear brand. The minimalistic Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star 70 Hi x A-COLD-WALL Pavement iteration suits numerous fashion styles, ensuring the sneakers harmonise with most casual outfits. Samuel Ross, the brains behind A-COLD-WALL, gives the much-adored canvas basketball sneaker a more futuristic makeover without compromising Converse's traditional elements. For instance, the minimalistic black canvas upper allows the design to shine, highlighting the white stitching and semi-transparent rubber toe cap. However, it's the white tongue that breaks up the dark hue, giving the sneakers some much-needed freshness. You can't miss the grey ACW box on the sidewall and the alphanumeric A-COLD-WALL branding code along the lateral foxing.",

Utilising a navy mesh upper as a base layer observed on the toe box, the cutouts on the quarter and the collar, with suede overlays presented in a pure black on the toe cap, the quarter and the heel. This monochromatic composition offers little contrast aesthetically, except on the textures ‘N’ logo that graces the quarter that appears in a silvery grey colour with a layered back and white layers achieving additional pop. Completing the look is a touch of tan that braces the mesh sock liner and a pop of ruby red in the form of the NB logo on the diamond-patterned black tongue. All of the above sitting on a three-toned ENCAP midsole for all-day comfort.",

      "description": "Meet the New Balance 574 x Joe Freshgoods Conversations Amongst Us Sea Salt Silver. The retro-inspired sneaker is a creative collaboration between New Balance and Joe Freshgoods and one of many iterations focusing on the black experience. The Conversations Amongst Us collection is designed to make a statement while creating styles most people would feel proud to add to their evolving footwear rotations. According to Joe Freshgoods, the yellowed, vintage aesthetic reflects the brand's intention for the sneaker, as the hints of colour represent \"lingering positivity and hope\". The aged effect makes the sneakers look like they have been \"worn, battered, and muddled\" but stand firm due to \"resilience and reflection\".",
