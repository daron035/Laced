The familiar fusion of mesh fabric with suede overlays combines alongside the signature geometric cut-outs to complete the upper's unique design. Although theoretically monotonal, a more complex aesthetic is created on this trainer thanks to how each colour looks dependent on the material it is applied to. Beneath, a light grey mudguard with a slight green tint adds a slight contrast to the design, while the exaggerated sole of the Yeezy 500 Ash Grey is also present in a darker hue of ash grey to complete this latest entry to the Yeezy 500 catalogue.",

      "description": "Cast your minds back to All-Star Weekend in February when we saw Kanye West dishing out his new Yeezy silhouette from the back of a tank. Passers-by on the streets of Chicago forced to hand over the shoes on their feet to swap for that pair of QNTM Yeezys. Well fear not, we see the first basketball Yeezy shoe re-release on the 5th of September, and you will only have to swap money for them this time, not the shoes you are wearing. This version of the sneaker features lighter hues than we saw previously on the 'Barium', giving it a more summer-ready feel. The exoskeleton is made from the iconic primeknit we have become accustomed to on Yeezys. Dressed in grey, this comes together in a wave formation over the synthetic base to give the sneaker some serious texture. The cream, suede toe box rounds of the sneakers upper which seemingly draws inspiration from the 700 v2 toe box. In true basketball sneaker fashion, the shoe features an ankle collar made from black neoprene and secured with black taping. The black tongue and laces are perfectly complemented by the cream outsole which makes its way onto the base of the primeknit upper, becoming more translucent as it progresses upwards. This sneaker is most definitely not like any other Yeezy on the market and seems to be releasing in far more minimal quantities. A must-have for Yeezy heads and sneaker fanatics across the globe.",

Adidas have with this creation mastered the skill of 3D printing shoes, and using their coined FutureCraft technology they're revolutionizing what personalized footwear means through Digital Light Synthesis - process that in layman's terms uses light and oxygen to allow this shoe's light green midsole to be more breathable and cushioning for that extra comfort and spring. The shoes groundbreaking lattice structure resembling the conventional shape of the Adidas alphaBounce. This keeps the foot securely locked in place which is made even more robust thanks to the integrated lacing system. This shoe is pretty much as sci-fi as it's going to get in 2018, but is much more than a gimmick, a kick built with science with comfort and performance in mind, but still delivers with style and elegance. This shoe is a prototype for a whole wave of future products but doesn't mean it doesn't stand alone as a modern marvel, pick one up if you can.",

A shoe that initially released way back in 1984, the basketball sneaker became a lifestyle silhouette for many. In recent years, though, the Forum has not been discussed too much. That was up until now, with Adidas enlisting the help of Puerto-Rican Superstar Bad Bunny to capture the attention of sneakerheads worldwide. A coffee-themed brown version of the Bad Bunny Forum Low recently released and became an instant classic. Fortunately, though, we see a second colourway drop. The uppers come crafted from a mix of buttery, premium leather and plush suede. The sneaker is completely covered in the eye-catching pink colourway the dynamic duo has used. The skate shoe's mix of materials gives the illusion of layers throughout and even includes a velcro strap across the top with the wording \"YO VISTO ASI\", meaning \"I dress this way\". Underfoot, a heavyweight sole unit guarantees maximum comfort from this unimaginable sneaker. A must-have for Adidas and Bad Bunny fans, we expect this shoe to be in the Sneaker of the Year discussion at the end of 2021.",

This ensemble product is sheathed in waterproof Dyneema material, cinched by a tension cord and secured by a pair of adjustable straps with magnetic Fidlock buckles. That might sound like just a jumble of words you don't understand, but in layman's terms, it ensures that the inner shoe's model is protected from the elements at all times. The Dyneema wrap can be rolled down for a more traditional trainer vibe while the shoe’s modified SFB sole unit, finished in bright blue, features durable traction.

Due to popular demand worldwide, the sneakers were re-released in 2020 but with various updates, such as improved Zoom Air cushioning and an option to swap the volt laces with the extra pair of red. Of course, much of the sneaker style has remained the same, as the synthetic upper's polyurethane islands resemble the texture of snakeskin, improving its aesthetic appeal and durability.",
